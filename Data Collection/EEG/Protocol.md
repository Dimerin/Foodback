**Protocol for EEG Data Collection During Tasting:**

1. **First acoustic signal** – Indicates to the subject that they may bring the food to their mouth to begin tasting.
2. **Second acoustic signal (after 5 seconds)** – Marks the beginning of EEG data collection. From this moment:
  
   - The subject must avoid any movement of the mouth and body.
   - It is recommended to keep the eyes closed to reduce noise in the EEG signals.
   - Normal breathing is allowed.

3. **Third acoustic signal (10 seconds after the second)** – Indicates the end of the EEG recording.

4. **Experience Evaluation** – The subject expresses their level of appreciation by assigning a score from 1 to 5, where:
   
   - 1 = not appreciated at all
   - 5 = highly appreciated
